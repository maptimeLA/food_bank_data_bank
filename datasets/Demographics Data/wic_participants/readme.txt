This data was pulled from HealthyCity.org.

All zip codes collected from (http://ceo.lacounty.gov/forms/zipcodes/master%20zip%20codes.pdf) - found by way of (http://ceo.lacounty.gov/pio.htm)

while it was requested that we collect these via a batch output, HealthyCity.org could not seem to handle a request of WIC participants in all zip codes within LA County without timing out, so I broke the array of LA County zip codes into thirds. While slow, this did result in actual data.
