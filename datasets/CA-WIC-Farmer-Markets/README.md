Systems) form that displays farmers markets throughout California that
are WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) certified. It contains
infromation about the markets that have both FMNP (Farmers Market
Nutritional Program) or FVC (Fruit and Vegetable Checks) certification,
their WIC identification, locations, and when they are held. This was
developed by the California Department of Technology, and information

Agriculture). These locations were further specified and gathered by
